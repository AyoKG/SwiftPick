"yours_truly_info" = "Shrouded in greenery, Yours Truly is a chilled bar-café on the ever-buzzy Kloof Street, where you can truly feel the rhythm and energy of the Mother City. Situated next to a backpackers’ lodge, it’s a popular hangout for student travellers, the beard-and-tattoo brigade, and anyone who enjoys delicious pizzas (the Deluxe is a personal favourite), interesting sandwiches, and cold beer on tap. As the sun starts setting and the place fills up, move on up to the Up Yours rooftop terrace, where super-cool local DJs take things to the next level (pun intended). If you’re lucky, resident bulldog Molly, who is just the cutest, might make a guest appearance.";
